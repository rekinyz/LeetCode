Leetcode Problems
=========================

####Algorithms
There are some typical approaches/techniques such as Divide-and-conquer (e.g. [Merge k sorted lists](https://rekinyz.wordpress.com/2015/02/15/merge-2k-sorted-lists-using-divide-and-conquer-approach/) ), Dynamic Programming (e.g. [Generate parentheses](https://rekinyz.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/generate-parentheses-using-dynamic-programming/)), Greedy, Backtracking (e.g. [Find letter combinations of a phone number](https://rekinyz.wordpress.com/2015/02/03/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/) ), Branch-and-Bound... that are useful for designing algorithms. 

Some of these approaches are described in the algorithm books e.g. «Algorithm Design and Applications» by Michael T. Goodrich & Roberto Tamassia. I'm not suggesting you need to be expert of these approaches, but I humbly submit that you should at least know what they are before or after you starting with the questions.

####Introduction
Leetcode provides a library with over 180 algorithm and database questions. I am not finished yet with all of them. I've tried to solve these problems with good time and space complexity as far as possible (no warranty, I am still working on it). Though you could use my test cases to check more or less the correctness of your own solution before you commit them to the Leetcode. The unit tests are not perfect either, so welcome improve them.

####Utilities
Besides I have committed the predefined data structures into the util package as well with diverse useful methods e.g. array to tree converter, tree printer, array to linkedlist converter etc. Feel free to use them or extend them for simplifying the tests.

####Attention
Since we are designing algorithm, using of some of the built in methods of java objects or special data structure should be avoided. For example using the methods other than charAt() of String oject are IMO "cheating". I didn't notice that at the beginning as well, when I get some time I will review the committed code again.

enjoy solving!
